# Intent
infect a victim and execute specific commands, whose results are stored back to the C2 (GDoc), optionally have a reverse shell. Spread through SMB shares
<br>
The implant should initialy exchange a AES key with the C2, all implants should have unique key. The evasion techniues can be based on this key.
