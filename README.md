## My Mal-Dev experiment with Nim, and Google Workspace for C2
This repository contains potentially harmful content related to malware research. The content is provided for educational and research purposes only.

Uses startProcess to execute cmds, so no sophisticated malware here. Dont try to hack someone with this. I'm not responsible for any misuse of this code.
# Intent
infect a victim and execute specific commands, whose results are stored back to the C2 (GSheet), optionally have a reverse shell. Spread through SMB shares (or something)
<br>
The implant should initialy exchange a AES key with the C2, all implants should have unique key. The evasion techniues can be based on this key.
